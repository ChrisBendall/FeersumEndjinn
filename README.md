My first repository, trying to create a branch but the instructions make no sense... What they ask me to do does not exist anywhere I am looking...
So turns out, I had to "Commit" to some notes int he Readme file before I could create a new branch... So had to do "Step 3" of the instruction manual before "Step 2"...
I am setting up Github so aI can do a Pytorch course on Deep Learning
